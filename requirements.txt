# Removed invalid / typo packages: 'cv2' and 'pytouch' were not valid pip packages.
# torch is intentionally omitted from automatic pinning because it commonly causes
# dependency conflicts (notably `typing-extensions` range clashes with TensorFlow).
# Install PyTorch separately using the official selector so you can pick the
# correct build for your platform (CPU or CUDA) and avoid resolver errors.
# Example (CPU-only):
#   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
# Or visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the recommended command.
